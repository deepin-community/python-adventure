Debian source package for Colossal Cave Adventure
=================================================

Build source package from VCS
=============================

The source for the Debian packaging is managed in these conventional
Git branches:

* master: The current released code base.
* packaging: Debian packaging development branch.
* upstream: Upstream source code base, as imported from tarballs.
* pristine-tar: Metadata for reproducibly generating upstream tarball.

To build the source package from the Git VCS, use the Debian ‘gitpkg’
tool to generate all the files::

    $ git checkout master
    $ gitpkg packaging upstream

The ‘dpkg-source’ process will complain about the “deletion” of
upstream source. This is because the upstream source is not present at
all in the ‘packaging’ branch exported, but in the ‘upstream’ branch.
The upstream source is safely exported earlier in its own tarball.

The generated source package is the source control file
‘../deb-packages/python-adventure/python-adventure_$DEBIANVER.dsc’ and
its associated files in that directory.
